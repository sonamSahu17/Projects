But ask him about the game and his sleep-deprived mind comes alive as he recalls the riveting speech captain Rohit Sharma gave at the team huddle, minutes before the final against the South Africans.\r\n\r\nTalking to The Indian Express from Barbados, Surya, whose spell-binding catch on the ropes to dismiss David Miller turned the match on its head, says, “He told us to keep it simple but said, ‘I can’t climb this mountain alone. If I have to reach the peak, I will need everyone’s oxygen’. He also said, ‘Joh bhi hai, paon mein, dimag mein, dil mein (Whatever you have in your legs, mind and heart), just bring everything to the game. If that happens, we will not regret the night’. We all were moved.”\r\nHe showed a graph of the number of T20 games the entire Indian team had played — from Virat bhai to Yashasvi Jaiswal (the most junior member). That number was 800-plus,” says Surya. “And then he showed a second slide that had the number of games that the entire coaching staff, including Rahul bhai, had played — that number was 1. He said to us, ‘You are the best judge here to make the right call at the right time. So leave every other thing to us, go out there and enjoy your game’.”\r\nSuryakumar says the team had a motto that was followed all through the campaign. “Before the start, we decided that we won’t talk about what lies ahead in the tournament. Nobody thought about Super 8 and the same was true for the finals in Barbados. Our mind has to be where our feet are — that was our motto,” he says.\r\n\r\nOn Rohit’s leadership style, Suryakumar says, “He connects with the players. Off the field, be it in a hotel room, or on the beach, he connects with everyone. So when a crunch situation comes, players know that he (Rohit) will back us. One feels I have to deliver for this man for the confidence and respect he gives to everyone.”\r\nSurya says the team’s never-quit spirit, which came in handy during key moments in the tournament – be it in the game against Pakistan, where India came back late in the game, or the final, when they rallied together to fight despite South Africa needing just 26 runs from 24 balls with six wickets intact – stems from a deep self-belief.\r\n\r\n“Everyone, starting from the captain, was relaxed because we knew that one magical thing will happen and we will be back in the game. And the way Bumrah and Arshdeep bowled was remarkable.”\r\nHe says he will remember the final not just for his catch, but for two moments, which, he says, will stay with him for years to come.\r\n\r\nOne of these is of the acutely self-conscious Dravid letting himself go when Kohli thrust the trophy into his hand. “That 30-second clip, when he took the trophy in his hand and screamed… that moment when he expressed his happiness. I think I will save that clip for life,” Suryakumar says.', '34', '01 Jul, 2024', 40, '1719913618-sp1.png'),

(48, 'How Long Do Migraine Attacks Last? What to Expect', 'Migraine episodes may last anywhere from a few hours to multiple days. Seek medical attention if your symptoms last longer.\r\nHow long will a migraine episode last?\r\nA migraine attack typically lasts from 4 to 72 hoursTrusted Source but can also last longer. It can be difficult to predict how long an individual episode will last, but charting its progress may help.\r\n\r\nMigraine episodes can usually be divided into four or five distinct stages. Not all people with migraine experience each of these phases during each episode. Phases can include:\r\n\r\nwarning or premonitory phase\r\naura (not all people with migraine experience this phase, and those who do may not experience it during every episode)\r\nheadache, or main attack\r\nresolution period\r\nrecovery or postdrome stage (not all people with migraine experience this phase, and those who do may not experience it during every episode)\r\nSome of these phases may only last briefly, whereas others may last much longer. You may not experience each phase with every episode you have. Keeping a migraine journal can help you track any patterns and prepare for what’s to come.\r\n\r\nKeep reading to learn more about each stage, what you can do to find relief, and when to see a doctor.\r\n\r\nWhat to expect during the prodrome (warning) phase\r\nSometimes, migraine can begin with symptoms that have absolutely nothing to do with a headache.\r\n\r\nThese symptoms can include:\r\n\r\ncraving certain foods\r\nincreased thirst\r\nstiff neck\r\nirritability or other mood changes\r\nfatigue\r\nanxiety\r\nPremonitory symptoms can last anywhere from 1 to 24 hours before the aura or headache phases begin.\r\n\r\nWhat to expect during the aura phase\r\nAbout 25%Trusted Source of people with migraine experience aura. Aura symptoms typically happen before the headache, or main attack, occurs. It often occurs 10 to 30 minutesTrusted Source before the headache pain begins.\r\n\r\nAura symptoms can last anywhere from 5 minutes to 1 hourTrusted Source.\r\n\r\nAura can include a wide range of neurological symptoms. You may see:\r\n\r\ncolored spots\r\ndark spots\r\nsparkles or “stars”\r\nflashing lights\r\nzigzag lines\r\n“heat waves”\r\nYou may feel:\r\n\r\nnumbness or tingling\r\nweakness\r\ndizziness\r\nanxiety or confusion\r\nYou may also experience disturbances in speech and hearing. In rare casesTrusted Source, fainting and partial paralysis are possible.\r\n\r\nAlthough these symptoms usually precede a migraine headache in adults, it’s possible for them to occur at the same time. Children may be more likely to experience an aura at the same time as their headache.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, aura symptoms may come and go without ever leading to a headache.\r\n\r\nWhat to expect during the headache phase\r\nMost casesTrusted Source of migraine aren’t accompanied by aura symptoms. Migraine without aura moves directly from the warning stage into the headache stage.\r\n\r\nHeadache symptoms are typically the same for migraine with and without aura. They may include:\r\n\r\npulsing pain on one or both sides of your head\r\nsensitivity to light, noise, odors, or even touch\r\nblurred vision\r\nnausea\r\nvomiting\r\nloss of appetite\r\nlightheadedness\r\nworsening pain with physical activity or other movement\r\nDuring a migraine attack, many people may be unable to work or continue with their usual daily activities.\r\n\r\nThis phase is the most unpredictable, with episodes lasting anywhere from a few hours to a few daysTrusted Source.\r\n\r\nWhat to expect during the postdrome phase\r\nMany migraine headaches gradually fade in intensity. Some people find that taking a nap can help relieve their symptoms. Children may only need to rest a few minutes to see results. This is known as the resolution phase.\r\n\r\nAs the headache begins to lift, you may experience the recovery phase. This can include a feeling of exhaustion or even of elation. You may also feel:\r\n\r\nmoody\r\ndizzy\r\nconfused\r\nweak\r\nYour symptoms during the recovery phase may pair with symptoms you experienced during the warning phase. For example, if you lost your appetite during the warning phase you may now find that you’re ravenous.\r\n\r\nThese symptoms may last for up to a dayTrusted Source after your headache.\r\n\r\nHow to find relief\r\nThere isn’t one right way to treat a migraine. If your migraine episodes are infrequent, you may be able to use over-the-counter (OTC) medications to treat symptoms as they occur.\r\n\r\nIf your symptoms are chronic or severe, OTC treatments may not be helpful. A doctor may be able to prescribe stronger medication to treat existing symptoms and help prevent future attacks.\r\n\r\nHome remedies\r\nSometimes, changing your environment may be enough to relieve the bulk of your symptoms.\r\n\r\nIf you can, seek solace in a quiet room with minimal lighting. Use lamps instead of overhead lighting, and draw the blinds or curtains to block sunlight.\r\n\r\nThe light from your phone, computer, TV, and other electronic screens may exacerbate your symptoms, so limiting your screen time may help.\r\n\r\nApplying a cold compress and massaging your temples may also provide relief. If you aren’t feeling nauseous, upping your water intake may also be helpful.\r\n\r\nIt can also help to track, identify, and avoid what’s triggering your symptoms. This may help reduce symptoms and prevent them from recurring.\r\n\r\nCommon triggers can include:\r\n\r\nstress\r\ncertain foods\r\nskipped meals\r\ndrinks with alcohol or caffeine\r\ncertain medications\r\nnot getting enough sleep\r\nhormonal changes\r\nweather changes\r\nconcussions and other head injuries\r\nOTC medication\r\nOTC pain relievers may help with symptoms that are mild or infrequent. Common options include:\r\n\r\naspirin (Bayer)\r\nibuprofen (Advil)\r\nnaproxen (Aleve)\r\nIf your symptoms are more severe, you may want to try a medication that combines a pain reliever and caffeine, such as Excedrin. Caffeine has the potential to both trigger and treat migraine episodes, so you may want to avoid this product unless you’re sure that caffeine isn’t a trigger for you.\r\n\r\nThese medications shouldn’t be used more than 10 to 15 daysTrusted Source per month. Doing so can lead to medication overuse headaches.\r\n\r\nPrescription medication\r\nIf OTC options aren’t working, you may decide to talk with a doctor.\r\n\r\nThey may be able to prescribe stronger, more targeted medications to help ease the pain.\r\n\r\nThis may include triptans, such as:\r\n\r\nsumatriptan (Imitrex, Treximet)\r\nzolmitriptan (Zomig)\r\neletriptan (Relpax)\r\nrizatriptan (Maxalt)\r\nalmotriptan\r\nIf your migraine episodes are chronic, a doctor may also prescribe medication to help prevent future episodes. These medications may include:\r\n\r\nCalcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists: rimegepant (Nurtec ODT) or ubrogepant (Ubrelvy)\r\nSelective serotonin 1F receptor agonist: lasmiditan (Reyvow)\r\nThey may also prescribe medication to help relieve nausea.\r\n\r\nWhen to talk with a doctor\r\nIf you’re experiencing a migraine episode for the first time, you may be able to relieve your symptoms with home remedies and OTC medications.\r\n\r\nBut if you’ve had multiple migraine episodes, you may want to make an appointment with a doctor. They can assess your symptoms and develop a treatment plan tailored to your individual needs.\r\n\r\nYou should see your doctor right away if:\r\n\r\nYour symptoms began after a head injury.\r\nYour symptoms last longer than 72 hours.\r\nYou’re 40 years old or older and are experiencing a migraine for the first time.\r\nYou develop a sudden severe headache.\r\nYou’re over the age of 50.\r\nYour headaches have changed in quality.\r\nYou have a headache that occurs with neurological symptoms, such as weakness on one side of the body, numbness, loss of vision, loss of consciousness.\r\nTakeaway\r\nA migraine episode typically lasts anywhere from 4 to 72 hours.\r\n\r\nIt consists of four or five phases during which you may experience other symptoms. During the headache phase, you may experience throbbing pain and sensitivity to light, sound, smell, or touch.\r\n\r\nA doctor can prescribe prescription medication that may help relieve pain and prevent future episodes.', '33', '01 Jul, 2024', 41, '1719911269-helth3.png'),

(53, 'How EU’s Digital Markets Act will impact Apple and its AI strategy', 'Apple recently announced that the rollout of its flagship AI offering in the European Union (EU) has been deferred, citing regulatory uncertainties. Besides Apple Intelligence, new iOS features such as Phone Mirroring and SharePlay Screen Sharing enhancements will also not be rolled out to EU users this year.\r\n\r\nThe reason behind the delayed rollout is the EU’s competition legislation called the Digital Markets Act (DMA) which has been in effect since 2022. While DMA was brought in to curb the dominance of big tech companies, Apple said provisions of the law such as its interoperability requirements “could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security.”\r\n\r\n“We are committed to collaborating with the European Commission in an attempt to find a solution that would enable us to deliver these features to our EU customers without compromising their safety,” the iPhone maker said in a statement.\r\nWhat are DMA requirements forcing Apple to push pause on its AI rollout? How has the EU responded to the tech giant’s concerns? And will the legislation similarly impact other Apple features that are in the making? We explain.\r\n\r\n‘Stunning, open declaration’: EU competition chief\r\nDays after Apple announced its decision, Margrethe Vestager, Competition Commissioner, EU, said the tech giant has an obligation to be open for competition in Europe. “I find that very interesting, that they say we will now deploy AI where we’re not obliged to enable competition. I think that is the most sort of stunning, open declaration that they know 100% that this is another way of disabling competition, where they have a stronghold already,” Vestager was quoted as saying by The Verge at the Forum Europa event. \r\nThis is far from the first time that Apple has locked horns with EU regulators. Most recently, the European Commission held that the big tech company had violated DMA by charging app developers a fee if they wanted to steer customers towards subscription channels other than the Apple App Store.\r\n\r\nWhile Apple is allowed to appeal the Commission’s findings in its preliminary investigation, it has 12 months to comply with the DMA or face fines amounting to 10 per cent of its annual global turnover, according to a report by The Guardian.\r\nWhat is the interoperability rule under EU’s DMA?\r\nThe DMA classifies tech giants such as Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and a few other services as ‘gatekeepers’ that are mandated to follow specific rules including allowing users to install third-party apps or app stores, allowing users to uninstall pre-installed apps and change defaults, giving users options to stop being profiled for targeted advertising and the like.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the interoperability rule highlighted by Apple requires gatekeepers to ensure that its messaging services are interoperable with messaging services offered by other smaller developers. For instance, Apple would have to make a few basic functionalities of its iMessage app interoperable while more complex features have to be made interoperable over time.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, gatekeepers are required to respond to interoperability requests made by smaller developers within a fixed timeline.\r\nGiven these requirements, Apple is likely concerned that smaller developers would be able to put in an interoperability request and obtain a peak under the hood of its AI system. Another potential point of contention could be the integration of OpenAI’s ChatGPT with Apple devices. According to DMA, end users have to be allowed to opt out in case they don’t want their provider to become interoperable with a gatekeeper.\r\n\r\nApple is not alone in temporarily shelving its rollout of AI features for EU users. Last month, Meta had to delay launching its AI chatbot in the region after its stated policy of using users’ public posts on Instagram and Facebook to train its AI model came under scrutiny by privacy regulators. Google’s Gemini also faced regulatory hurdles after the EU’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) said it had not received adequate information on how the generative AI model would impact a user’s privacy, as per reports.\r\nBesides big tech, digital rights groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) had criticised the interoperability rule of the DMA as it could weaken end-to-end encryption in messaging services. “Many security experts agree that requiring interoperability without unacceptable tradeoffs in security or privacy is a very high hurdle, one that might turn out to be insurmountable,” EFF said in a blog post in May 2022.', '37', '01 Jul, 2024', 42, '1719907092-tech2.png'),
(54, 'Meta AI is fun, accessible, and free. Maybe it’s finally time to make AI chatbots part of your life', 'Last week, like many others, I noticed a blue ring icon appear at the top right corner above the search bar on WhatsApp. I had been anticipating the rollout of Meta’s new AI chatbot but was not particularly excited. In fact, Meta had been testing its AI chatbot for months in India, but now Meta AI is rolling out to the company’s main apps, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp.\r\n\r\nAlso read | Meta infuses AI into WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger, and Instagram in India\r\nHonestly, my interest in AI chatbots peaked a long time ago. I have been occasionally using them for specific things, but they haven’t grown on me, nor have I become addicted to them. I still Google all my search queries, spend a lot of time on Reddit for Bollywood stuff, and get news from websites. That leaves less scope for a user like myself to make an effort to download an app or change my habits to log into a new service on a browser to use an AI chatbot.\r\n\r\nAlso read | Meta AI on WhatsApp lets you access Gen AI on the go: Here’s how to use it\r\nMeta’s AI assistant came as a surprise when I had almost forgotten about the existence of these chatbots. Completely free to use, Meta AI resides inside WhatsApp, the app I use most in everyday life. And that is exactly why over the past week I have used this chatbot more than others over the past two years. This in-app integration could finally help familiarise many users with GenAI exactly because of this aspect. Here are the things I like and didn’t like about Meta’s AI chatbot.\r\nImages created using AI have been a controversial topic, and there is definitely a need for standards regarding content provenance and ownership. However, in the context of sending AI-generated images to friends and family using a chat app like WhatsApp, this one seems harmless. Meta’s AI and its ability to generate images by typing a “description” make emojis so much fun. It’s safe too—the “Imagine with AI” label ensures the image is created using AI. For example, I typed, “imagine a photograph of a cat having fun in a pool in the summer.” In seconds, Meta AI created a convincing image. I felt Meta AI was faster in creating AI images than other image generators, which can take up to a minute to create an AI image. Sure, there are plenty of AI image generators, but having a feature built right into a chat app makes a lot of sense. Clearly, Meta is giving a large user base a user-friendly way to experiment with AI image generation without the risk of copying another artist’s style. The more users generate AI images and send them in messages, the more they become familiar with GenAI. To me, this may become Meta’s gateway to massify GenAI.        \r\nI am not into food blogging, nor do I enjoy watching cooking videos online. However, it often happens that I hear about a specialty dish I had eaten in a restaurant and, out of curiosity, want to know the recipe. I remember watching a viral video of Deepika Padukone where she mentioned Ema Datshi, Bhutan’s national dish. It was a simple and easy-to-make dish at home. So, I asked Meta’s AI assistant to find a recipe for Ema Datshi. Meta pulled up the exact recipe I had seen in videos on social media. The good thing about Meta AI is that it shows the ingredients and instructions in an easy-to-digest format, without unnecessary information. I asked the AI assistant for a recipe that could be prepared at home with minimal ingredients and in less than 10 minutes. Meta AI responded with a recipe for Ema Datshi, which is super easy to prepare. But at this point, I wanted more options, so I typed, “ask for more suggestions.” Meta AI then came up with five recipes that can be made in less than 10 minutes. It was a major time saver, as I didn’t have to scroll through pages of food blogs or find videos on YouTube.\r\nWhen it comes to shopping for a tech product, I do not trust unreliable sources, especially AI chatbots, which have irked me in the past due to their limited knowledge and inability to search for up-to-date information. However, since Meta’s AI assistant uses Google Search and Bing to fetch results, I was willing to give it a try and see how it fares in shopping.\r\n\r\nI told Meta AI that I currently own an iPhone 13 mini and am looking for a new phone under Rs 50,000. Meta produced a list of smartphones that can be bought under Rs 50,000. The recommendations were good and included a mix of both the newest phones and older smartphones. I was not expecting that, honestly. I quizzed Meta AI with many questions, and the AI assistant gave me the precise answers I was looking for. For instance, I asked Meta, “Should I switch to Android considering I use iMessage on my iPhone?” and Meta responded with this:\r\n“If you’re deeply invested in the Apple ecosystem and rely heavily on iMessage, switching to Android might not be the most seamless experience. iMessage is exclusive to Apple devices, so you won’t be able to use it on an Android phone.”\r\n\r\nI found the answer satisfactory. For context, Meta AI also recommended chat apps like WhatsApp and Telegram that are cross-platform and work on both iOS and Android, but I never felt it was forcing me to use only WhatsApp or suggesting it was better than iMessage.\r\n\r\nSummarise articles\r\nA lot of the time, if I am late to an event or need to catch a flight, I prefer to read short summaries rather than full news articles. It’s more convenient, even though sometimes depth is missing, but you still get the relevant information. I asked Meta to summarise a news article published on indianexpress.com titled “Indians spending more on foreign travel.” I cut and pasted the URL into my prompt, and Meta was able to summarise the article. The summary was not bare bones; it included all the necessary context, such as why Indians are travelling more, the reasons behind it, and the supporting numbers.\r\n\r\nHowever, I found that Meta didn’t produce precise summaries of articles when it was an interview with many flowing quotes. I asked Meta to summarise an article I wrote during Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference last month, which was based on a roundtable with the media and top executives. Instead of summarising my article, Meta came up with a generic summary detailing Apple Intelligence features, far from what the article was about. To my surprise, Meta relied on other publications’ articles to pull results for the summary. The problematic part was that those articles lacked original reporting and did not even cover the discussion Apple’s executives had with the media, talking about all things Apple Intelligence. The only common thing between them and my article was the keyword “WWDC 2024.”', '37', '01 Jul, 2024', 42, '1719906865-tech1.png'),
